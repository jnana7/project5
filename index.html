        <p class="para">My hobby is swimming in my free time. It is one of my favorite sports. Swimming is the most beneficial way to eases muscle pains and aches and alleviates stress. Swimming also helps to relax and improve the cardiovascular fitness. Swimming is a very good exercise. It has many uses. Swimming helps build a strong and healthy body for those who practice this form of exercise regularly. It has various curative values or qualities. During swimming the swimmerâ€™s rate of respiration increases. As a result, the lungs get proper exercise. Thus swimming helps us to cure asthma which is so common in towns and cities due to ever-increasing air pollution. Swimming is an interesting and exciting game. It has, therefore, been included in different mega sports competitions such as National Games, Asian Games, and Olympics. I've been swimming since I was 8 and it is one of my favourite things to do.
